Data Policy

   This policy describes the information we process to support Facebook,
   Instagram, Messenger and other products and features offered by
   Facebook ([66]Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional
   tools and information in the [67]Facebook Settings and [68]Instagram
   Settings.
   Return to top

What kinds of information do we collect?

   To provide the Facebook Products, we must process information about
   you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our
   Products. You can learn how to access and delete information we collect
   by visiting the [69]Facebook Settings and [70]Instagram Settings.
   Things you and others do and provide.
     * Information and content you provide. We collect the content,
       communications and other information you provide when you use our
       Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or
       share content, and message or communicate with others. This can
       include information in or about the content you provide (like
       metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was
       created. It can also include what you see through features we
       provide, such as our [71]camera, so we can do things like suggest
       masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using
       camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and
       communications you and others provide to analyze context and what's
       in them for the purposes described [72]below. Learn more about how
       you can control who can see the things you [73]share.
          + Data with special protections: You can choose to provide
            information in your Facebook [74]profile fields or Life Events
            about your religious views, political views, who you are
            "interested in," or your health. This and other information
            (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or
            trade union membership) could be subject to special
            protections under the laws of your country.
     * Networks and connections. We collect information about the people,
       [75]Pages, accounts, [76]hashtags and groups you are connected to
       and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people
       you communicate with the most or groups you are part of. We also
       collect contact information if you [77]choose to upload, sync or
       import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS
       log history), which we use for things like helping you and others
       find people you may know and for the other purposes listed
       [78]below.
     * Your usage. We collect information about how you use our Products,
       such as the types of content you view or engage with; the features
       you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact
       with; and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For
       example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products,
       and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products.
       We also collect information about how you use features like our
       camera.
     * Information about transactions made on our Products. If you use our
       Products for [79]purchases or other financial transactions (such as
       when you make a purchase in a game or make a [80]donation), we
       collect information about the purchase or transaction. This
       includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card
       number and other card information; other account and authentication
       information; and billing, shipping and contact details.
     * Things others do and information they provide about you. We also
       receive and analyze content, communications and information that
       other people provide when they use our Products. This can include
       information about you, such as when others share or comment on a
       photo of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your
       contact information.

   Device Information
   As described below, we collect information from and about the
   computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you
   use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information
   across different devices you use. For example, we use information
   collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better
   personalize the content (including [81]ads) or features you see when
   you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet,
   or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed
   you on your phone on a different device.
   Information we obtain from these devices includes:
     * Device attributes: information such as the operating system,
       hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength,
       available storage space, browser type, app and file names and
       types, and plugins.
     * Device operations: information about operations and behaviors
       performed on the device, such as whether a window is foregrounded
       or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish
       humans from bots).
     * Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers,
       such as from games, apps or accounts you use, and Family Device IDs
       (or other identifiers unique to [82]Facebook Company Products
       associated with the same device or account).
     * Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby
       Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
     * Data from device settings: information you allow us to receive
       through device settings you turn on, such as access to your GPS
       location, camera or photos.
     * Network and connections: information such as the name of your
       mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number,
       IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about
       other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do
       things like help you [83]stream a video from your phone to your TV.
     * Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including
       cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the
       [84]Facebook Cookies Policy and [85]Instagram Cookies Policy.

   Information from partners.
   Advertisers, [86]app developers, and publishers can send us information
   through [87]Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social
   plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our [88]APIs and
   SDKs, or the Facebook [89]pixel. These partners provide information
   about your activities off Facebook--including information about your
   device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and
   how you use their services--whether or not you have a Facebook account
   or are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use
   our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us
   about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive information
   about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party
   data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.
   Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services or
   through third parties they work with. We require each of these partners
   to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before
   providing any data to us. [90]Learn more about the types of partners we
   receive data from.
   To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Facebook
   Business Tools, review the [91]Facebook Cookies Policy and
   [92]Instagram Cookies Policy.

How do we use this information?

   We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) as
   described below and to provide and support the Facebook Products and
   related services described in the [93]Facebook Terms and [94]Instagram
   Terms. Here's how:
   Provide, personalize and improve our Products.
   We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including to
   personalize features and content (including your [95]News Feed,
   [96]Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for
   you (such as groups or [97]events you may be interested in or topics
   you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized
   Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections,
   preferences, interests and activities based on the data we collect and
   learn from you and others (including any [98]data with special
   protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our
   Products; and the people, places, or things you're connected to and
   interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use
   information about you to personalize your Facebook and Instagram
   experience, including features, content and recommendations in Facebook
   Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the [99]ads that
   you see.
     * Information across Facebook Products and devices: We connect
       information about your activities on different Facebook Products
       and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on
       all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example,
       we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes
       people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger.
       We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by
       automatically filling in your registration information (such as
       your phone number) from one Facebook Product when you sign up for
       an account on a different Product.
     * Location-related information: We use [100]location-related
       information-such as your current location, where you live, the
       places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near-to
       provide, personalize and improve our Products, [101]including ads,
       for you and others. Location-related information can be based on
       things like precise device location (if you've allowed us to
       collect it), IP addresses, and information from your and others'
       use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or events you attend).
     * Product research and development: We use the information we have to
       develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting
       surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products
       and features.
     * Face recognition: If you have it turned on, we use face recognition
       technology to recognize you in photos, videos and camera
       experiences. The face-recognition templates we create may
       constitute [102]data with special protections under the laws of
       your country. Learn more about [103]how we use face recognition
       technology, or control our use of this technology in [104]Facebook
       Settings. If we introduce face-recognition technology to your
       Instagram experience, we will let you know first, and you will have
       control over whether we use this technology for you.
     * Ads and other sponsored content: We use the information we have
       about you-including information about your interests, actions and
       connections-to select and personalize ads, offers and other
       sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we
       [105]select and personalize ads, and your choices over the data we
       use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the
       [106]Facebook Settings and [107]Instagram Settings.

   Provide measurement, analytics, and other business services.
   We use the information we have (including your activity off our
   Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help
   advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and
   distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of
   people who use their services and how people interact with their
   websites, apps, and services. [108]Learn how we share information with
   these partners.
   Promote safety, integrity and security.
   We use the information we have to verify accounts and activity, combat
   harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences,
   maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security
   on and off of Facebook Products. For example, we use data we have to
   investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies,
   or to [109]detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the
   [110]Facebook Security Help Center and [111]Instagram Security Tips.
   Communicate with you.
   We use the information we have to send you marketing communications,
   communicate with you about our Products, and let you know about our
   policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when
   you contact us.
   Research and innovate for social good.
   We use the information we have (including from research partners we
   collaborate with) to conduct and support [112]research and innovation
   on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public
   interest, health and well-being. For example, [113]we analyze
   information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid
   relief efforts. [114]Learn more about our research programs.

How is this information shared?

   Your information is shared with others in the following ways:
   Sharing on Facebook Products
   People and accounts you share and communicate with
   When you share and communicate using our Products, [115]you choose the
   audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook,
   you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your
   friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when
   you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or
   businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send.
   Your network can also see actions you have taken on our Products,
   including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other
   accounts see who has viewed their Facebook or Instagram Stories.
   [116]Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,
   including if they don't have an account. This includes your Instagram
   username; any information you share with a public audience; information
   in your [117]public profile on Facebook; and content you share on a
   Facebook Page, [118]public Instagram account or any other public forum,
   such as [119]Facebook Marketplace. You, other people using Facebook and
   Instagram, and we can provide access to or send public information to
   anyone on or off our Products, including in other Facebook Company
   Products, in search results, or through tools and APIs. Public
   information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through
   third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media
   such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate
   with our Products.
   Learn more about what information is public and how to control your
   visibility on [120]Facebook and [121]Instagram.
   Content others share or reshare about you
   You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who
   can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with
   others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside
   the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post or
   send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download,
   screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our
   Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as
   [122]Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or
   react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone
   who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the
   audience later.
   People can also use our Products to create and share content about you
   with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of
   you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share
   information about you in their posts or messages. If you are
   uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products,
   you can learn how to [123]report the content.
   Information about your active status or presence on our Products.
   People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are
   active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on
   [124]Instagram, [125]Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our
   Products.
   Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.
   When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services
   that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive
   information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a
   game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share
   button on a website, the game developer or website can receive
   information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or
   link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you
   download or use such third-party services, they can access your
   [126]public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share
   with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook
   friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you
   use will not be able to receive any other information about your
   Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram
   followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose
   to share this information themselves). Information collected by these
   third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not
   this one.
   Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and
   Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps)
   will have access to all information you choose to share with them,
   including information your friends share with you, so they can provide
   our core functionality to you.
   Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even
   further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'
   access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their
   app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next
   version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app
   review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo
   and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.
   New owner.
   If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their
   assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.
   Sharing with Third-Party Partners
   We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our
   Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,
   which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free
   services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your
   information to anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict
   restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we
   provide. Here are the types of third parties we share information with:
   Partners who use our analytics services.
   We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and
   businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts,
   listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook
   Products. For example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles
   receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed,
   reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate
   demographic and other information that helps them understand
   interactions with their Page or account.
   Advertisers.
   We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing
   their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share
   information that personally identifies you (information such as your
   name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or
   identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we
   provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers
   (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and
   34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them
   better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads
   led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
   Measurement partners.
   We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to
   provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.
   Partners offering goods and services in our Products.
   When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a
   seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your
   public information and other information you share with them, as well
   as the information needed to complete the transaction, including
   shipping and contact details.
   Vendors and service providers.
   We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who
   support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure
   services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer
   service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
   Researchers and academics.
   We also provide information and content to research partners and
   [127]academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and
   innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery
   and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological
   advancement, public interest, health and well-being.
   Law enforcement or legal requests.
   We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal
   requests in the circumstances outlined [128]below.
   Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you
   or others share with third-party partners in the [129]Facebook Settings
   and [130]Instagram Settings.

How do the Facebook Companies work together?

   Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology
   with other [131]Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus)
   to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience
   across all [132]Facebook Company Products you use. We also process
   information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes,
   as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and
   policies. For example, we process information from WhatsApp about
   accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action
   against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger. We also
   work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company
   Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different
   Facebook Company Products.
   Return to top

How can I manage or delete information about me?

   We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your
   data. Learn more in your [133]Facebook Settings and [134]Instagram
   Settings.
   We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services
   and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever
   comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on
   things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed,
   and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when
   you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that
   query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that
   search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your
   government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that
   copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about
   deletion of [135]content you have shared and [136]cookie data obtained
   through social plugins.
   When you delete your account, we [137]delete things you have posted,
   such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to
   recover that information later. Information that others have shared
   about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't
   want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the
   Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your
   account at any time, please visit the [138]Facebook Settings and
   [139]Instagram Settings.
   Return to top

How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?

   We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law
   enforcement or others:
     * In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order
       or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires
       us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from
       jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a
       good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that
       jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent
       with internationally recognized standards.
     * When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect,
       prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products,
       violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal
       activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or
       Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or
       regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
       For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive
       information from third-party partners about the reliability of your
       account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and
       off our Products.

   Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data
   related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved
   for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or
   obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible
   violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We
   also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for
   at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
   Return to top

How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?

   We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook
   Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect
   and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your
   information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or
   stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of
   where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data
   transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the
   [140]Facebook Terms and [141]Instagram Terms and to globally operate
   and provide our Products to you. We utilize [142]standard contract
   clauses, rely on the European Commission's [143]adequacy decisions
   about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for
   these data transfers to the United States and other countries.
   Return to top

How will we notify you of changes to this policy?

   We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the
   opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue
   using our Products.
